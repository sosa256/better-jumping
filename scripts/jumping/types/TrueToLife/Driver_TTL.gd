## DESCRIPTION
# Remember gravities and inital velocities have been multiplied by -1 already.
#
# Your mileage may vary with the maxed height and distance.
# Copied from JumpCurve.gd
# "Actually did some testing and 
# the larger this [inital velocity] has to be the more inaccurate. I haven't bashed 
# my head heard enough but it's starting to hurt. Future me fix it! (if you can)"
# 
# Basically "There will be some error proportional to how fast/large 
# the inital velocity turns out to be."

# For finding actual max height and distance.
