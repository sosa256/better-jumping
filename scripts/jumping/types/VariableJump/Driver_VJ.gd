## DESCRIPTION
# Remember gravities and inital velocities have been multiplied by -1 already.
#
# Your mileage may vary with the maxed height and distance.
# Copied from JumpCurve.gd
# "Actually did some testing and 
# the larger this [inital velocity] has to be the more inaccurate. I haven't bashed 
# my head heard enough but it's starting to hurt. Future me fix it! (if you can)"
# 
# Basically "There will be some error proportional to how fast/large 
# the inital velocity turns out to be."

## DATA
# Player's current velocity.
var velocity := Vector2.ZERO setget set_velocity, get_velocity

# Get coyote time script from Node.
onready var ct = get_node("CoyoteTime")

# Buffer time in ms.
var jump_buffer := 0.016 # Roughly one frame

# var max_hight_dist is already in parent class VJ.gd.
